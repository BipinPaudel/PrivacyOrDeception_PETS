Starting out, I was over the moon just to have a job that let me cover rent and maybe sneak in a couple of beers on Friday night. But as the years zoom, the bar for what's 'enough' keeps getting set higher – saving for a house, planning for a fam, and let's not even talk about trying to have a decent vacay without the budget blues hitting you. I'm curious, have you folks felt that shift in gears too? Has what you consider a comfy income changed? Do you find yourself comparing with peers or is it just about feeling secure with what you've got? Let's spill the beans.\n        Adapted_text: Redditors, how has your perception of financial stability changed over time?\n    \n\n\n\nOnly answer in the given format and do not add any additional information.\n\n"
