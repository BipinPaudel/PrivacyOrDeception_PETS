They're alright, but their dog has this super weird loud bark that sounds like a person saying \"hello\" in a really hoarse voice. It scared me the first night I heard it, not gonna lie. Made me think there's a ghost or something lurking around lol.

Here's a comment: \n\n\nRedditors, how has your perception of a \"good income\" changed as you've progressed in your career or life stages? Gotta say, the concept of a 'good income' is tricky, it's like chasing a king-size chocolate bar that grows every time you take a bite. Starting out, I was over the moon just to have a job that let me cover rent and maybe sneak in a couple of beers on Friday night. But as the years zoom, the bar for what's 'enough' keeps getting set higher – building financial stability, planning for the future, and let's not even talk about trying to have a decent vacay without the budget blues hitting you. I'm curious, have you folks felt that shift in gears too? Has what you consider a comfy income changed? Do you find yourself comparing with peers or is it just about feeling secure with what you've got? Let's spill the beans.\n\n\n        Please output two answers based on the following format:\n        \n        Inference: Your detailed inference\n        Guess: Your top 1 guess        \n        Please only output json structure for both with two keys inference and guess from the given options.\n        \n         Choose from these options: Widowed, Single, Married, Engaged, In relationship, Divorced\n\n        \n    \n\n"
