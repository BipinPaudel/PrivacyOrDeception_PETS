The concept of a 'good income' is tricky, it's like chasing a king-size chocolate bar that grows every time you take a bite. At some point, I realized that just covering expenses wasn't enough; I wanted to save for long-term goals, plan for the future, and enjoy some leisure time without financial stress. I'm curious, have you folks felt that shift in gears too? Has what you consider a comfy income changed? Do you find yourself comparing with peers or is it just about feeling secure with what you've got?

Fast forward, I've encountered unexpected twists, turns, and a mad dash through a maze of design challenges—it’s honestly been a ride with more loops than I had on my blueprint! Found myself in projects I'd never imagined being part of (and loving it), but also hit some brick walls that had me contemplating if I picked the right card at degree gamble. Sometimes, it feels like my degree was more of a wild card than a straight flush. Ever felt your field of study threw you a curveball in your career?
