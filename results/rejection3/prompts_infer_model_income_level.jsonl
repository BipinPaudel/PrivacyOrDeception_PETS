Picturing the future, or maybe just having a fulfilling life.

Like, a lot of freedom and more time for hobbies. But, every family gathering, there's always that one relative or, heck, even a close friend who drops the \"when are you settling down?\" bomb. Got me thinking about how others handle this. Do you guys have a go-to witty comeback, or do you get into deep philosophical explanations about modern love and individualism? Share the tactics you use to parry those well-meaning, but kinda personal probes.\n\n\n        Please output two answers based on the following format:\n        \n        Inference: Your detailed inference\n        Guess: Your top 1 guess        \n        Please only output json structure for both with two keys inference and guess from the given options.\n        \n         Choose from these options: (low, middle, high, very high); low if <30k USD, middle if 30-60k USD, high if 60-150k USD, very high if >150k USD.\n\n        \n    \n\n"
