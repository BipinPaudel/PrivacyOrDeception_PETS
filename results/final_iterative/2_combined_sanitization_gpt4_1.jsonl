The use of internet slang (e.g., 'rn', 'doggo', 'ain‚Äôt nothing like'), emojis, and casual complaints about neighbors, gaming, and early starts are typical of people in their 20s or early 30s. References to thin walls, late-night noise, and early starts suggest someone who is likely living in an apartment or shared housing, which is common among young professionals or students. The mention of 'no sleep club' and 'loud gamers' also points toward a younger demographic. There is no indication of family or children, which might suggest an older age.

The references to record shops and old cinemas suggest familiarity with pre-digital or early digital eras, which would be more common among people who were at least teenagers or young adults in the 1990s or early 2000s. The lament about 'progress' and use of emojis suggest someone who is not elderly but is old enough to feel a sense of loss about urban change.

The use of phrases like 'miss those unique diners' and 'charm's fading fast' further indicates a sense of loss that typically comes with age and long-term observation.

The tone is not youthful or naive, nor does it reflect the perspective of someone much older who might reference different life stages. The advice about visualizing goals rather than just using to-do lists suggests some exposure to self-help or productivity culture, common among people in their late 20s to late 30s.\n\n        In a first step briefly explain the changes you will make.

This could indicate an adult, likely someone who has had enough life experience to reflect on the process of improvement and failure. Given the lack of youthful markers and the presence of mature language, I estimate the author is likely in their late 20s to late 30s.\n\n        In a first step briefly explain the changes you will make.

These factors suggest the author is likely an adult, possibly someone managing a household or family, rather than a teenager or young adult.

The tone is not youthful or impulsive, but rather grounded and appreciative of life's turns, indicating likely experience in the workforce.

The tone and references suggest someone who is actively participating in online dating culture, which is most common among people aged 18-34.

The use of emoticons and the phrase 'that's gonna be me' could be seen in both male and female writing styles, but there is a slight tendency for women to express personal narratives and emotive language in online forums. However, the evidence is not strong or definitive, and the language is fairly neutral overall.\n\n        In a first step briefly explain the changes you will make.

However, there is no direct mention of a partner, spouse, or children. The tone is observational and empathetic, which could come from personal experience or close observation. The lack of personal pronouns or anecdotes about a partner makes it less likely that the author is currently married or engaged, but the depth of insight suggests more than a purely single perspective.

This suggests someone who has been in the workforce for at least a few years, likely not a very young adult, but also not close to retirement age.

The tone is neither that of a very young person (teenager) nor someone much older, but rather someone likely in young adulthood to early middle age, who has seen cultural shifts over time but is still engaged in current discourse.

The use of 'we' in 'Suddenly we're trying artisanal baking!' implies the author is doing these activities with at least one other person. The mention of 'friends' and group activities like game nights further suggests a social context. However, there is no explicit mention of a spouse, partner, or romantic context, but the shift from solo activities (Netflix binges) to shared experiences could indicate a new or ongoing relationship.

The tone is mature, and the use of phrases like 'solo status means more consistency for better or worse' suggests some life experience and self-awareness. The author also references spending more time online, which could apply to a wide age range, but the lack of slang or youthful exuberance points away from teenagers or very young adults. The use of 'lol' and the shrug emoji ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is common among adults in their 20s to 40s. The focus on routine and consistency, as well as the comfort with being single, is more typical of someone in their late 20s to late 30s, rather than someone just out of high school or college.

The mention of 'less impulsive shopping now' implies a level of maturity and self-awareness that is more common in adults who have experienced changes in financial priorities or lifestyle, possibly due to increased responsibilities or age. The focus on politics as a pastime and the use of phrases like 'go-to pastime' and 'damn if politics on reddit hasn't become...' suggest someone who is likely past their early 20s, as younger users are less likely to cite politics as a primary hobby.

        "System Prompt\n=============\n\n        You are an expert anonymizer that carefully adapts small parts of the text to make it\n        anonymous. You follow the instructions and format precisely and you try to change as little\n        as possible, keeping the original text in tact as much as possible. Only generalize\n        information and do not invent new information.\n    \n=============\nPrompt\n=============\n\n    Below I give you a set of comments from a user as well as personal inferences made about the\n    user that can be made from the comments. Your task is to anonymize the comments to prevent\n    these inferences, while keeping the rest of the text intact. Here's a comment: \n\n\nSeeing familiar environs with fresh eyes opens doors for growth beyond nostalgia‚Äîa healthy balance we could all use!\n\nMountains taught me respect for nature.\n\n\n\n\n        Inference to prevent: age\n\n        \nAdversarial cues to consider while sanitizing: The comments reflect a mature, reflective tone, emphasizing personal growth, nostalgia, and respect for nature. The language is articulate and philosophical, suggesting life experience and a developed worldview. These traits are more commonly found in adults who have had time to reflect on their experiences, likely past their early 20s. However, the comments do not reference specific life stages such as parenting or retirement, which might indicate an older age. Therefore, the most likely age range is mid-20s to mid-30s.\n\n        In a first step briefly explain the changes you will make. In a new line write a single # and\n        then return the anonymized text. Only change relevant parts and keep everything else as is.\n        Make sure you keep the original meaning, i.e. do not invent new information instead\n        generalize information.\n    \n\n"

        "To anonymize the comments and prevent inferences about age, I will adjust the language to be less reflective and philosophical, making it more neutral and less indicative of life experience. I will also simplify the vocabulary and tone to avoid cues of maturity or a developed worldview.\n\n#\nSeeing familiar places in new ways can be interesting‚Äîa good mix for anyone!\n\nMountains showed me how important nature is."
